NDI TAP Assessment 2023

For this technical assessment, I will be developing a fullstack project. This project is a prototype that solves problem statement defined below, written in Node.js with JavaScript, using Pug template engine, Express.js framework for backend, and basic data storage with SQLite.

## Problem Statement

Over the recent years, scams in Singapore are becoming more and more sophisticated.
Such scams could come in many forms, but the common scams can be categorised under:

-   Call scam
    -   These scams often involves the scammers trying to pry into the victims' personal/sensitive information in order to obtain access into their bank accounts.
-   Job scam
    -   These scams often involves the scammers sending recruitment ads through messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram, enticing unsuspecting victims by promising high pay with short working hours. The victims will be required to fork out their own money at some point in time, and eventually be rug pulled.
-   Online Marketplace scam
    -   These scams often involves the scammers pretending to sell goods at a significantly cheaper price point than anywhere else. These scammers will not deliver the goods that the victims have paid for, and often they will go missing after the victim has paid.
-   Donation scam
    -   These scams often involves the scammers pretending to be a part of charitable organisations and asking victims for donations.

Although there are campaigns which aims to educate Singaporeans on these common scams, it is simply one part of a deterrence and may not be enough to curb the sophisticated scams that scammers have been developing.

## Proposed Solution

As such, I would like to propose **IdentifyMe**, a platform that allows individuals or business representatives to guarantee their identity during their exchange with the customers.

Individuals may apply for an identification profile by applying with MyInfo. Registered businesses will be able to apply for such identification profiles on behalf of their employees by applying with MyInfo Business. These applications will be instantly approved as their identities are guaranteed by MyInfo.

Similar to an NRIC or driver license, these identification profile will be locally recognised as a form of identification. These identification profile will be used in professional context, and will only contain information that is safe for the public to see.

Every identification profile will have a photo of the individual, an identification code, their full name, the organisation that they are representing (if applicable), and a QR code (future implementation).

The customer must be allowed enter the identification code or scan the QR code (future implementation) on the platform. The platform should display the exact same identification profile, and record this interaction under the customer's contact history log to facilitate swift tracking of the individual or business representative when necessary.

My solution aims to provide Singaporeans with a method to verify the identity of any individual or business representative in local context. On the other hand, these individuals and business representatives can safely assure their customers with ease, allowing better conversations to happen.
